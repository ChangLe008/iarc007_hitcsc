* @brief Define logical direction of vbus, i.e. the direction of selected Guidance Sensor. Note that they are only defined by the VBUS ports on Guidance Core, not by the Guidance Sensors. The comment of each element indicates the default direction when Guidance is installed on Matrice 100. However the developers can install Guidance in any manner on any device, thus the directions might also be different.
